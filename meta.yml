synopsis: Coq sources and exercises from the Coq'Art book

description: |-
  Coq'Art is the familiar name for the first book on the Coq proof assistant
  and its underlying theory, the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
  This project contains the Coq sources of all examples and the solution to 170
  out of over 200 exercises from the book.
