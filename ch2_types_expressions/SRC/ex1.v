(* EXAMPLES *) 
(* The following function takes two arguments a and b
which are numbers of type nat and returns b + 2 * (a + b) *)
Definition f_ex (a b : nat) := b + 2 * (a + b).

(* When p is a pair, you can access its components by the "pattern-matching"
  construct illustrated in the following function. *)
Definition add_pair_components (p : nat * nat) :=
  match p with (a, b) => a + b end.

(* f_ex is a function with two arguments.  add_pair_components is a
  function with one argument, which is a pair. *)

(* END OF EXAMPLES *)

(* 1/ Define a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns
  the sum of the squares of these numbers. *)

(* 2/ Define a function that takes 5 arguments a b c d e, which are all
   numbers and returns the sum of all these numbers. *)

(* 3/ Define a function named add5 that takes a number as argument and returns
   this number plus 5. *)

(* The following should return 8 *)
(* Compute add5 3.*)

(* The following commands make it possible to find pre-defined functions
Search nat.
Search bool.
 *)

(* 4/ Write a function swap of type list nat -> list nat such that
  swap (a::b::l) = (b::a::l)  and
  swap l' = l' if l' has less than 2 elements. *)

(* 5/ Write a function proc2 of type list nat -> nat, such that
   proc2 (a::b::l) = (b + 3) and
   proc2 l' = 0 if l' has less than 2 elements.

   In other words, proc2 only processes the 2nd argument of the list and
   returns that number plus 3.  If there is no second argument to the list,
   proc2 returns 0.  *)

(* 6/ Write a function ms of type list nat -> list nat such that
      ms (a::b::...::nil) = a+2::b+2::...::nil
      For instance
      ms (2::3::5::nil) = (4::5::7::nil) *) 

(* 7/ Write a function sorted of type list nat -> bool, such that
    sorted l = true exactly when the natural numbers in
   l are in increasing order. *)

(* 8/ Write a function p2 of type nat -> nat such that 
    p2 n = 2 ^ n *)

(* 9/ Write a function salt of type nat -> nat -> nat such that
   salt x n = x ^ n - x^ (n-1) + x^(n-2) .... + 1 or -1, if x <> 0,
   depending on the parity of n, thus
   salt x 3 = x^3 - x^2 + x - 1
   salt x 4 = x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1
   salt 2 3 = 5

   You may have to define auxiliary functions. *)


(* 10/  Consider the following definition *)

Inductive btree : Type :=
|  leaf 
|  bnode (n:nat)(t1 t2: btree).

(* write a function that list the labels of a tree by infix order *)
(** you may use the concatenation function app on lists 
  (also written l1 ++ l2 ) *)


(* write a boolean function that checks whether a tree is a binary 
search tree *)
